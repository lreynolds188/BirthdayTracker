Sam has asked you to prepare a small Java application that might be used for tracking friends, clients and family names, likes, dislikes and birth-dates.

The application will allow Sam to: •	Enter new person records - names, likes, dislikes, day of birth and month of birth. •	Various navigation buttons: •	First, last, next and previous record buttons •	A Find button to search for an existing record by person name •	New, Save and Delete buttons. •	A popup screen to show the upcoming birthdays for the current month, presented in order of first to last in the month.

The application will save and load the people data to and from a text file: MyFriendData.txt.
